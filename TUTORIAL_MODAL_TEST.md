# Tutorial Modal Test

## Issues Fixed

1. **Removed Container import** - Container was causing issues in the modal
2. **Simplified structure** - Used only necessary Chakra UI components
3. **Fixed z-index** - Set to 9999 to ensure modal appears above everything
4. **Fixed backdrop** - Added proper backdrop blur and overlay
5. **Fixed positioning** - Used fixed positioning with proper centering

## Test Steps

1. **Click Tutorial Button** - Should open modal overlay
2. **Check Modal Display** - Should show step 1 with proper styling
3. **Test Navigation** - Previous/Next buttons should work
4. **Test Progress** - Progress bar should update correctly
5. **Test Close** - X button and Skip should close modal
6. **Test Responsive** - Should work on mobile and desktop

## Expected Behavior

- Modal should appear as overlay with dark background
- Content should be centered and properly styled
- Navigation should work smoothly between steps
- Progress indicators should update correctly
- Modal should close properly on all close actions

## If Still Not Working

Check browser console for errors and verify:
- Chakra UI components are properly imported
- No CSS conflicts
- JavaScript errors in console
- Modal state management is working
